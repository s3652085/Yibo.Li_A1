            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
			
			 <p>This is what I got from three different tests, there are from:</p>
             
			  <p>Myers-Briggs test:  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality" class = "link" target ="_blank">Links</a></p>
              <p>Learning style test:  <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments" class = "link" target ="_blank">Links</a></p>
              <p>Big Five Personality test:  <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" class = "link" target ="_blank">Links</a></p>

					 <p>As can be seen from the results of these tests, I have a more emotional personality than ordinary people, and slightly higher creativity and empathy ability than ordinary people. My love for art and music also enables me to think in a different way.  
But my weakness is also more obvious, do things not too careful.  When I work, I tend to rely on my intuition, and the result is full of uncertainty, because intuition can sometimes make things better, but sometimes it can also mess things up.  
I think I should listen more to the advice and guidance of members with more experience and professional knowledge in the team.  If I set up a team by myself, I will find people who are complementary to me. They can settle down to work, think rationally in dealing with things, and deal with problems carefully  </p>
