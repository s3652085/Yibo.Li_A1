                     <p>The position was a programmer for a web company, which appealed to me because it happened to involve web development. This career requires at least three years of computer science and the ability to use PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and relational databases (MySQL). However, I need to learn relevant courses in the current Bachelor of Business Information Systems course. Although I have only learned some basic web page editing courses and have not met the professional requirements for this job, I believe that learning an in-depth understanding of this knowledge in RMIT will help me. After a period of practice and accumulation of experience, I can be competent for the work of a programmer.</p>
